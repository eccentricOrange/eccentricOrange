ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eccentricOrange. I'm a high-school student that loves robotics. Most of my code here is probably more acadmic though but I'll gradually upload more...
- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop)
- Currently exploring Linux and Raspberry Pi
- Want to learn JavaScript and C# (the kind used in Windows)
