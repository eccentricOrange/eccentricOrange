ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a college student that loves robotics, and is currently studying Electrical Engineering at the Bachelor's level. Most of my code here is probably more academic but I'll gradually upload more projects, whenever they reach a sane level of documentation.

- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop)
- Currently exploring C, more Python, Linux and Raspberry Pi, the web-dev trio (HTML/CSS/JS), Flutter.
- Learning about: core electrical/electronics, MATLAB and SimuLink.
- Want to learn game development, [@ros](https://github.com/ros/), and Rust. Also want to learn core CS (data structures and algorithms), and the aspect of SWE that teaches you to scale software with users/data.
