ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a high-school student that loves robotics. Most of my code here is probably more acadmic but I'll gradually upload more projects, whenever they reach a sane level of documentation.

- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop)
- Currently exploring C, more Python, Linux and Raspberry Pi, the web-dev trio (HTML/CSS/JS). Also exploring the open-source world, tooling (like IDEs, containers, CI/CD, testing etc), and the "community" side of things.
- Want to learn .NET, C, and C# (the kind used in Windows). Also want to learn core CS (data structures and algorithms), and the aspect of SWE that teaches you to scale software with users/data.

I am @anujthecreator on most social media, and [whatever this user ID is](https://stackexchange.com/users/15114379/eccentricorange) on Stack Exchange.
