ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eccentricOrange. I'm a high-school student that loves robotics. Most of my code here is probably more acadmic but I'll gradually upload more...
- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop)
- Currently exploring C, more Python, Linux and Raspberry Pi, the web-dev trio (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Want to learn .NET, C, and C# (the kind used in Windows)

I am @anujthecreator on most social media.
