ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a college student that loves robotics, and is currently studying Electrical Engineering at the Bachelor's level. Almost all projects uploaded here are something I've needed in real life.

Check out my personal blog: https://eccentricorange.netlify.app/ \[[repo](https://github.com/eccentricOrange/personal-blogs/)\]

- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino, ESP32), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop), KiCAD (PCB designing), physical electronics
- Currently exploring: STM32 and ESP32 embedded C dev, RTOS, ROS2, PCB Designing
- Learning about: core electrical/electronics, control systems, power electronics, kinematics, localization
- Want to learn: core CS (architectures, OS, DSA, scaling, virtualization), the wizard-like skills old electrical engineers have
- Other random skills: Git, Docker, Linux, CI+CD, Raspberry Pi, soldering, PCB designing, technical documentation
- Random interests: articulately-written fiction, music production, OS-level vulnerabilities, intersection of quantum mechanics and astrophysics, table tennis, cool algorithms
