ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eccentricOrange. I'm a high-school student that loves robotics. Most of my code here is probably more acadmic but I'll gradually upload more...
- I work with: Python, C++ (Arduino), LabVIEW (myRIO FPGA, Desktop)
- Currently exploring JavaScript, Linux and Raspberry Pi
- Want to learn .NET, C, and C# (the kind used in Windows)

Look at my [StackOverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/eccentricorange) if you want to learn more about the technologies and projects I've worked with.
